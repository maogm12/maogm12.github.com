A simple implementation of identicon. It looks simple but cute, have nice random color.

Here is a example for text `maogm12@gmail.com`:

<img src="../../images/icon_128_128.bmp" alt="identicon for 'maogm12@gmail.com'" />

I have completed it in multi-language, python, javascript and php for the moment.

Look my [git repo][identicon_repo] for details, or have a look at the 
[javascript](./test_identicon.html) version.
